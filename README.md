### Summary:

Glance is a web app developed to give users quick information about their days and the world around them "at a glance." For this project, I was inspired to make a project that seemed simple enough that it couldn't get scope-creeped, but useful enough that people would actually use it. I also wanted to create a project that would consume APIs and make use of ES6's asynchronous functions to write clean and easy to understand requests. For design, I went with a modern, mobile first design as I envisioned that the web app would mainly be used on phones. I took inspiration from the way Trello uses Unsplash's API to add a fun touch to the project's background.
